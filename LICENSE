GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. \n51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA \nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                 Preamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you are aware that you can do these things.  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that you, too, receive the source code or can get it if you want it. You must tell the recipients of your software how they can secure these freedoms for themselves.\n\nIf you modify the software and distribute it, you must make the modified source available so that everyone else also has the freedom to share and change it.  You must do this by offering access to the source code, or by saying where the source code can be found.\n\nThis is what we mean by copyleft.\n\n==== 1. Definitions ====
\n"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.\n\n"You" refers to the licensees of the Program, and "Your" has a corresponding meaning.\n\n"Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.\n\nA "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe "System Libraries" of an executable work are those parts of the common tools and libraries that are used, or special interface libraries, that are part of the operating system on which the executable work runs, or that are used by the executables.  However, they do not include the part of the work that is derived from the Program, or a work that is combined with the Program.\n\n``Licensing'' means providing a copy of this License and copying License text into other works.\n\n==== 2. Basic Permissions ====
\nYou are allowed to:  (1) make and distribute copies of the Program's source code, (2) use the Program, (3) make changes to it, (4) combine it with other works, and (5) distribute copies of the Program and any changes you make.\n\nYou can do these things provided that you follow the and restrictions laid out in sections 3, 4, and 5, otherwise, you can not.\n\n==== 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law ====
\nNo additional restrictions can be placed on the Program that would restrict users' freedom of use.\n\n==== 4. Conveying Copied and Modified Versions ====
\nYou are allowed to make and distribute copies of the Program you received under this License, provided that you follow the conditions of the License.\n\nYou can also make changes to the Program for yourself, and then distribute copies of the modified work, provided that those copies are clearly marked as modified and that the License remains intact.\n\n==== 5. Conveying Non-Source Forms ====
\nYou are allowed to convey copies of the Program in object code or executable form, without offering the source code, provided that you follow the conditions in this License.\n\n==== 6. Additional Terms ====
\nYou may add your own conditions to the end of this License, except for those that conflict with existing terms.  If you add conditions, you must address what you are requiring.\n\n==== 7. Termination ====
\nYou can lose your rights to this License if you violate its terms and/or conditions.\n\n=== 8. Non-Warranty ====
\nThere is no guarantee that the Program is free from bugs.\n\n=== 9. Accepting the License ====
\nBy copying or distributing the Program, you indicate your acceptance of this License.\n\n==== END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS ====
\nHow to Apply these Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program and want it to be time-tested, the best way is to integrate it into a package that uses the GPL (GNU General Public License) standards. A copy of the license should be included in the new program along with acknowledgments of the prior works used in its development.\n\nHopefully, the software you develop will contribute to the success of free software in a global sense and offer liberties to users.  Consider adapting your work for another licence by re-evaluating your project's aims to find the best fit for all parties involved.\n\nWhat other licenses are commonly used alongside the GPL?\n\nLicenses which are often used alongside the GPL or come from the same family of software licenses include LGPL, AGPL, and other variants.\n\nFollowing existing systems can further increase the software's usability and encourage engagements from users eager to extend their capabilities.\n\nThis License was compiled by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
